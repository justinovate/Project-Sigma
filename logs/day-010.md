# Day 10 — January 10, 2026

**Focus:** Solving ODEs (MATLAB) & Integration Drills

### 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] **Certification:** Continue "Solving Ordinary Differential Equations with MATLAB" (MathWorks).

### ✅ Completed

- [ ] _Pending: Completed MathWorks Modules._

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **EDA Reflection:** Finished the Module 1 exam. Felt shaky on some concepts; plan to rebuild intuition using R/MATLAB starting tomorrow.
- **DE Insight:** The MathWorks course visualizes how `ode45` steps through a solution, which helps understand slope fields concepts.
