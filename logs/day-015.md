- [x] **Exam Prep:** Review Coursera & Mapúa modules for the upcoming DE Exam.
- [x] **Submission:** Submit all 10 Worksheets by the deadline.

### ✅ Completed

- [x]Bernoulli & Circuits.
- [x] Submission.

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **Circuits vs. Mixtures:** RL Circuits are just Mixture problems in disguise.
  - Concentration $C(t)$ $\leftrightarrow$ Current $i(t)$
  - Resistance $R$ $\leftrightarrow$ Outflow Rate
  - Inductance $L$ $\leftrightarrow$ Tank Volume
- **Bernoulli Tip:** The substitution $u = y^{1-n}$ turns the non-linear equation into a standard Linear one. Don't forget to swap back to $y$ at the end!
