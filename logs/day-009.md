# Day 9 — January 9, 2026

**Focus:** Joint Probability Distributions (EDA Exam Prep)

### 🎯 Goals for Today
- [ ] **Academics:** Solve Problem Set on Joint PDF/PMF.
- [ ] **Mastery:** Double Integrals & Marginal Distributions.
- [ ] **Project Sigma:** Update logs and verify one complex problem using MATLAB/R.

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Initialized Day 9 log.
- [ ] *Pending: Completed Joint Distribution Problem Set.*

### 📝 Engineering Notes
- **Key Challenge:** Setting up the bounds for double integrals (e.g., when $0 < x < y < 1$).
- **Strategy:** Drawing the 2D region is mandatory before integrating.
