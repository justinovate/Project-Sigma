# Day 14 — January 14, 2026

**Focus:** Differential Equations (Growth, Cooling, Mixtures)

### 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] **Academics:** Complete Law of Growth & Decay Worksheet.
- [x] **Academics:** Complete Newton's Law of Cooling Worksheet.
- [x] **Academics:** Complete Mixture Problems Worksheet (Brine Tanks).
- [ ] **Carry Over:** Bernoulli & Circuits (Moved to Day 15 Morning).

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Mastered setting up "Rate In - Rate Out" for mixture problems.
- [x] Solved temperature decay problems using $T(t) = T_{env} + Ce^{kt}$.

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **Mixture Logic:** The hardest part was getting the volume right. If flow in ≠ flow out, Volume is a function of time $V(t) = V_0 + (r_{in} - r_{out})t$.
