# Day 13 — January 13, 2026

**Focus:** Differential Equations (The Solvers)

### 🎯 Goals for the Day

- [x] **Academics:** Complete Separable Equations Worksheet.
- [x] **Academics:** Complete Linear Equations Worksheet (Integrating Factors).
- [x] **Review:** Integration by Parts (Applied during Linear DEs).

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Mastered the "Integrating Factor" technique $\mu(x) = e^{\int P(x)dx}$.
- [x] Solved Separable equations involving implicit solutions.

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **Key Realization:** Linear DEs always boil down to the Product Rule in reverse: $\frac{d}{dx}[\mu(x)y] = \mu(x)Q(x)$.
- **Trouble Spot:** Remembering the $+C$ early enough in Separable equations to handle initial conditions correctly.
