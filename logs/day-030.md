# Day 30 — January 30, 2026

**Focus:** Statistics Foundations & Mental Reset

### 🎯 The "Catch-Up" Sprint (Deadline: Jan 31)

- [ ] **EDA:** Watch Prof. Leonard's Central Limit Theorem lecture.
- [ ] **EDA:** Watch Prof. Leonard's Intro to Hypothesis Testing.
- [ ] **Review:** Re-solve ONE problem each from M2A1, M2A2, and M2A3 to verify the logic.

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Acknowledged burnout and reset the Project Sigma timeline.
- [x] Continued daily Python practice (Logic/Conditionals).

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **Burnout Analysis:** Intensive sprints without scheduled "buffer days" led to a productivity crash.
- **Restart Strategy:** Focusing on "Conceptual Intuition" rather than volume. If I understand the CLT, the formulas for CI and Hypothesis testing make sense.
