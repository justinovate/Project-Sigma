# Day 6 — January 6, 2026

**Focus:** R Programming Basics & Differential Equations

### 🎯 Goals for the Day

- [x] **R:** Create and commit R Basics Cheat Sheet (Vectors, Dataframes, Stats).
- [x] **Academics:** Study Differential Equations (Prof. Leonard - Homogeneous/Exact Eqs).
- [x] **Academics:** Review Integration Techniques (blackpenredpen - Integration by Parts/Sub).

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Finalized `r_basics_cheatsheet.R` for Engineering Data Analysis.
- [x] Evening Math Session.

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **R vs MATLAB:** Noticed that R uses 1-based indexing (like MATLAB) but uses `<-` for assignment instead of `=`.
- **Calculus Review:** Focusing on _Integration by Parts_ (LIATE rule) as it's heavily used in solving DEs.
