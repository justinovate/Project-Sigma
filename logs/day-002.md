# Day 2 — January 2, 2026

**Focus:** MATLAB Statistics & Inferential Statistics Foundations

### 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] Complete MATLAB Statistics Onramp
- [x] Create MATLAB Statistics Summary/Cheat Sheet
- [x] Start Module 2: Inferential Statistics (Duke University/Coursera)
- [x] Review Differential Equations (Prof. Leonard)

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Finished all modules of **MATLAB Statistics Onramp**.
- [x] Summarized statistical commands for Engineering Data Analysis.
- [x] Initialized studies for Duke's Inferential Statistics (R-programming prep).

### 📝 Quick Notes

- **EDA Sync:** The Onramp visualization techniques (Boxplots/Histograms) align perfectly with my Mapúa EDA module.
- **DE Focus:** Transitioning to Prof. Leonard for Differential Equations intuition.
