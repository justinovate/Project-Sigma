# Day 5 — January 5, 2026

**Focus:** Python Control Flow & Academic Rigor (DE/EDA)

### 🎯 Goals for Today

- [x] **Python:** Complete MIT 6.100L Pset 1 Part A (Basic Logic/Calc).
- [ ] **Academics (DE):** Study Differential Equations (Prof. Leonard - Separable Eqs).
- [ ] **Academics (EDA):** Engineering Data Analysis Review.

### ✅ Completed

- [x] Solved **Pset 1a**: Implemented basic mathematical logic in Python.
- [ ] _Pending: DE and EDA study session._

### 📝 Engineering Notes

- **Python Logic:** Ps1a required using loops and conditionals to solve a financial approximation problem.
- **Academic Balance:** shifting focus to Differential Equations tonight to prepare for upcoming problem sets.

### 💻 Code Snippet (Python)

_Logic from Ps1a (Conceptual):_

```python
# Basic compounding logic often found in Ps1a
current_savings = 0
while current_savings < total_cost:
    current_savings += (current_savings * r / 12) + monthly_saving
    months += 1
```
